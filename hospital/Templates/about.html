Having earned the trust and loyalty of patients through the compassion of its caregivers and high-precision medical technology, the institution has emerged as the leading quaternary care facility in the region. 

    Lifeline Hospital, established in 2014 was a thoughtful initiative from the renowned Lifeline (CMI) group of institutions to offer quality and affordable medical care to the common man. The legacy of Lifeline Hospital in pioneering a distinctive culture in the educational sector has helped them carve an exemplary medical institution in Kerala. The hospital is well laid out in a 40 acre green landscape in the serene setting of Chunangamvely, Aluva and is the closest facility to the Cochin International Airport.
